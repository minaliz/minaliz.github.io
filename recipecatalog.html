                <h2>CLASSIC APEROL SPRITZ</h2>
                <img src="photos/beverage1.png">
                <p>WHAT YOU NEED FOR THIS RECIPE:<br>
Aperol(Aperol is a bright orange apéritif. The brand describes the flavors as, “zesty orange with complex herbal scents harmonized with a touch of vanilla.”)<br>
Prosecco(Prosecco is an inexpensive Italian sparkling wine similar to Spanish Cava or French Champagne.)<br>
Club soda<br>
Slice of fresh orange<br>                    
HOW TO MAKE CLASSIC APEROL SPRITZ?<br>
Aperol spritz cocktails are unbelievably easy to make. No cocktail shaker or fancy equipment required!<br>
You’ll simply fill a wine glass with ice, then add Aperol, Prosecco, club soda and a slice of orange.<br>
How to Adjust Your Aperol Spritz<br>
The generally accepted ratio is equal parts Aperol and Prosecco plus a splash of club soda. However, you can play around with the ratio until your Aperol spritz tastes exactly the way you like it. I like mine with a little more Prosecco than Aperol.<br>
Make it less bitter.<br>
Aperol’s bitter notes can take some getting used to, so you can reduce the bitterness by using less Aperol and more Prosecco.<br>
Make it less boozy<br>                   
As written, your Aperol spritz is around 11 percent alcohol content by volume (Aperol is 11% ABV and Prosecco is 12%). To make it even lower in alcohol content, use proportionally more club soda and less Aperol and Prosecco.<br>                    
Aperol spritzes are ultra refreshing, not-too-sweet bubbly cocktails only takes 3 minutes to make.

                <h2>BURRATA AL TARTUFO</h2>
                <img src="photos/starter1.png">
                <p>WHAT YOU NEED FOR THIS RECIPE:<br>
2 Burrata<br>
olive oil, for drizzling<br>
truffle, to garnish (optional)<br>
crispbreads, to serve<br>
TRUFFLE SAUCE<br>
100g mushrooms<br>
25ml sunflower oil, plus 1 tsp<br>
10g truffles, minced<br>                    
HOW TO MAKE BURRATA AL TARTUFO?<br>
STEP 1<br>
First, make the truffle sauce. Blitz the mushrooms in a mini food processor until very finely broken down. In a medium frying pan, warm 1 tsp sunflower oil over a medium heat. Once hot, fry the mushrooms for 3-4 mins or until reduced and just cooked through. Remove from the heat and allow to cool before combining with the remaining sauce ingredients. Transfer to the fridge and leave to infuse for a few hours, ideally overnight.<br>
STEP 2<br>
To serve, put the truffle sauce into a large piping bag fitted with a small nozzle (or, if using a disposable piping bag, snip off a small hole for squeezing out). Pierce the base of each burrata, and use the piping bag to fill with the sauce until each burrata is extra plump, being careful not to overstuff. Dress with drizzles of oil, shavings of truffle, if using, and cracked black pepper and salt. Serve with crispbreads.<br>
This impressive dinner party starter of oozing, milky burrata with mushroom and truffles only takes 15 minutes to make.

                <h2>ORANGE POLENTA CAKE</h2>
                <img src="photos/dessert1.png">
                <p>WHAT YOU NEED FOR THIS RECIPE:<br>
250g unsalted butter<br>
250g golden caster sugar<br>
4 large eggs<br>
140g polenta<br>
200g plain flour<br>
2 tsp baking powder<br>
zest and juice 2 oranges (less 100ml juice for the glaze)<br>
For the orange glaze<br>
100ml orange juice<br>
100g golden caster sugar<br>
HOW TO MAKE ORANGE POLENTA CAKE?<br>
STEP 1<br>
Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Line the base and sides of a round 23cm cake tin with baking parchment. Cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time and mix thoroughly. Once the mixture is combined, add all the dry ingredients and the zest and juice after you have measured off 100ml for the glaze.<br>
STEP 2<br>
Transfer the mixture to the tin, spread evenly, then cook for about 45 mins or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Remove from the oven and turn out onto a wire rack to cool.<br>
STEP 3<br>
To make the glaze, put the juice and sugar in a medium saucepan and bring to the boil. Let it simmer for 5 mins, then remove from the heat and allow to cool. Drizzle the orange glaze over the top of the cooled cake. Serve with Lemon ice cream, below.<br>
An Italian flavour with this moist and fruity polenta cake only takes 20 minutes to make.</p>
